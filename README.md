## Welcome to my profile!

Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan and I'm committed to acquiring ux and technical writing experience through collaboration on open source projects.

I have little knowledge of code but I am improving my skillset through any mean. As I figure out how to navigate Github and the various open source projects of the world, I hope you bear. I look forward to making new connections and contributing to unique projects!
