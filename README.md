## Welcome to my profile!

Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan and I'm interested in acquiring technical writing experience through collaboration on open source projects.

I have little knowledge of code but I am planning to learn any skillset necessary to improve. As I figure out how to navigate Github and the various open source projects of the world, I hope you can bear with me on my journey.
