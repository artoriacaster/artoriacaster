Hi, I’m @artoriacaster

I’m interested in acquiring technical writing experience through collaboration on open source projects. I have little knowledge of code but I am planning to learn any skillset necessary to improve. 

I’m currently in college pursuing an English Degree, and have a workload for school which takes priority over any open source contributions I can help with. Therefore I don't plan on large contributions which are required in a short span of time unless I am on any sort of break.
